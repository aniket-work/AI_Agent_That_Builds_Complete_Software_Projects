# Tutorial: Let's Build AI Agents That Build Entire Software Project For you

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- A basic understanding of virtual environments and command-line tools.

## Steps

1. **Virtual Environment Setup:**
   - Create a dedicated virtual environment for our project:
   
     ```bash
     python -m venv AI_Agent_That_Builds_Complete_Software_Projects
     ```
   - Activate the environment:
   
     - Windows:
       ```bash
       AI_Agent_That_Builds_Complete_Software_Projects\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - Unix/macOS:
       ```bash
       source AI_Agent_That_Builds_Complete_Software_Projects/bin/activate
       ```


   
# Installation and Setup Guide

**Install Project Dependencies:**

Follow these steps to set up and run the ResearchAgents project:

1. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```
   This ensures you're in the correct location for the subsequent steps.

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This command installs all the necessary Python packages listed in the requirements.txt file.

3. Create a new crew using crewai:
   ```
   crewai create crew research_agents
   ```
   This command sets up the initial structure for your ResearchAgents crew.

4. Copy the main files from the git repository:
   - Copy `main.py` and `crew.py` from the git repo into the autogenerated `research_agents/src/research_agents` directory.
   These files contain the core functionality of the ResearchAgents project.

5. Set up the environment variables:
   - Copy the content of `.env.example` into a new `.env` file under the autogenerated `research_agents/src/research_agents` directory.
   - Add your Groq API key to the `.env` file.
   This step ensures that your API key is securely stored and accessible to the application.

6. Add the settings file:
   - Copy `settings.json` into the autogenerated `research_agents/src/research_agents` directory.
   This file contains important configuration settings for the project.

7. Navigate to the research_agents directory:
   ```
   cd research_agents
   ```
   This positions you in the correct directory for the following Poetry commands.

8. Install Poetry:
   ```
   pip install poetry
   ```
   Poetry is used for dependency management and packaging in Python.

9. Add the langchain_groq package:
   ```
   poetry add langchain_groq
   ```
   This adds the langchain_groq package to your project dependencies.

10. Update and install dependencies:
    ```
    poetry lock
    poetry install
    ```
    These commands update the lock file with the new dependency and install all project dependencies in a virtual environment.

By following these steps, you'll have a fully set up and configured ResearchAgents project ready to run. This process ensures that all necessary components are in place, including the core files, environment variables, settings, and required packages.
